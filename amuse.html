        <h1>Internet Humor</h1>
  
        <h2>Pintrest Laugh</h2>
        <p>One of my oldest forms of internet laughs comes from pintrest. Here's a meme I found about sorority girls.</p>

        <h2>Reddit Laughs</h2>
        <p>I also enjoy a good Reddit laugh. Here's a thread I found about sorority girls. If you can't laugh about it, what else are you supposed to do lol.</p>

        <h2>Youtube Laughs</h2>
        <p>Lastly, one of my good pastimes is looking at SNL videos on Youtube. The video I am linking is one of my favorites. It is Ariana Grande playing a competive mom in a game of charades.</p>
