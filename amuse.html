    <h1>Internet Humor</h1>

    <h2>Pinterest Laugh</h2>
    <p>One of my oldest forms of internet laughs comes from Pinterest. Here's a meme I found about sorority girls.</p>

    <h2>Reddit Laughs</h2>
    <p>I also enjoy a good Reddit laugh. Here's a thread I found about sorority girls. If you can't laugh about it, what else are you supposed to do lol.</p>

    <h2>YouTube Laughs</h2>
    <p>Lastly, one of my good pastimes is looking at SNL videos on YouTube. The video I am linking is one of my favorites. It is Ariana Grande playing a competitive mom in a game of charades.</p>
